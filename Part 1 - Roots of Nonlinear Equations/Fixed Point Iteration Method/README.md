# Solving an Equation Using the Fixed-Point Iteration Method

## Objective

Implement the fixed-point iteration method to solve the equation 𝑥² − 3𝑥 + 2 = 0 using the fixed-point iteration method. This involves transforming the equation into a form suitable for iteration, selecting an initial guess, and iteratively applying the fixed-point formula to find an approximate solution within a specified tolerance. The aim is to understand and implement the method to achieve convergence to a root of the equation.

## Main Text for Solving Math

### Fixed-Point Iteration Method: Solving 𝑥² − 3𝑥 + 2 = 0

**Objective:**  
Use the fixed-point iteration method to solve the equation 𝑥² − 3𝑥 + 2 = 0.

### Steps

**Transform the Equation:**  
Rewrite the equation 𝑥² − 3𝑥 + 2 = 0 in the form 𝑥 = 𝑔(𝑥). One possible transformation is:

𝑥 = 𝑔(𝑥) = (𝑥² + 2) / 3

**Define the Function 𝑔(𝑥):**  
Use the transformation to define:

𝑔(𝑥) = (𝑥² + 2) / 3

**Choose an Initial Guess:**  
Select an initial guess, 𝑥₀ = 0.5.

**Iterative Formula:**  
Use the iterative formula to find successive approximations:

𝑥ₙ₊₁ = 𝑔(𝑥ₙ)

**Check for Convergence:**  
Continue the iteration until the difference |𝑥ₙ₊₁ − 𝑥ₙ| is smaller than a pre-specified tolerance 𝜖 (e.g., 𝜖 = 1×10⁻⁶), or until the maximum number of iterations is reached.
